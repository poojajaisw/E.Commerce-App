                    food designed for commercial resale,

                    of service. It is a commercial term,
                    
                        limited to food sold in a restaurant
                        or store with frozen, preheated or precooked
                        ingredients and served in packaging for
                        take-out/takeaway. Fast food was created as
                    
                            a commercial strategy to accommodate large
                            numbers of busy commuters, travelers
                            and wage workers. In 2018, the fast food
                            industry was worth an estimated $570 billion globally.[1]
